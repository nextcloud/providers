# Providers

Community maintained list of Nextcloud providers

**If you quickly want to sign up to a reliable Nextcloud provider that gives at least 2GB of free, unmetered storage (without any time limit), you can use our [simple signup](https://nextcloud.com/signup/) program where we select a provider for you based on your location.**

The approach of maintaining a list like this on GitHub has been less than ideal, so we decided to archive it. It is challenging to maintain well, prâ€™s often break things, and the list is outdated much of the time.

You can leave comments on your experiences with the providers or ask questions in our [hosting category on the forums.](https://help.nextcloud.com/c/hosting) Feedback is VERY much welcomed as it helps others to choose their ideal provider!

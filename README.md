    * good: “We offer Swiss-hosted servers with daily off-site backup. You can install Nextcloud apps, Talk, Calendar and Contacts included"
    * bad: “Awesome, Inc. is a successful hosting firm founded on solid engineering principles and is a leading provider of open source solutions.”

* Use English for your description
* Don't abuse the nextcloud trademark (you can't use our logo unless you have obtained permission to do so, see [nextcloud.com/trademarks/](https://nextcloud.com/trademarks/).

Somebody will review and approve, or tell you what to fix. *Note that that somebody can be a community volunteer. Nobody should ever ask you for access to your services or servers in any way - as that is not relevant for checking if you follow our trademark guidelines...*
